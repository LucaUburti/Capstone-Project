Fitness for Diabetics
Description 
For diabetic persons, keeping track of their blood sugar levels (glycemia) is paramount. Besides the diet, physical activity also plays a major role in altering the glycemic values. 
With this app diabetic persons can log their blood sugars levels throughout the day and complement this information with any workouts done on that particular day.
The app also has access to an online database with the glycemic index of common foods and a chart outlining the glycemic trends of the last few weeks.
All personal glycemic values are stored locally, so no sensitive data is transferred outside the phone.

Intended User
Diabetic people who want to record their glycemic levels throughout the day, together with any workouts done during that day
